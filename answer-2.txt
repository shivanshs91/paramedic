 Iterative Enhancement Model: This model has the similar phases as the waterfall model, but with fewer restrictions. In general the phases occur in the same order as in the waterfall model but these may be conducted in several cycles. A utilizable product is released at the end of the each cycle with each release providing additional functionality.


Evolutionary Development Model: Evolutionary development model bear a resemblance to iterative enhancement model. The similar phases as defined for the waterfall model occur here in a cyclical fashion. This model is different from iterative enhancement model in the sense that this doesn't require a useable product at the end of each cycle. In evolutionary development requirements are implemented by category rather than by priority.
